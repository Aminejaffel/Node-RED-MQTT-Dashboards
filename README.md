# Node-RED-MQTT-Dashboards
This project implements a real-time environmental monitoring system using an ESP32 microcontroller and a DHT22 sensor. Sensor data for temperature and humidity are sent over MQTT to a Node-RED server, which processes and visualizes the data on a live dashboard.
Features
Real-time acquisition of temperature and humidity data

MQTT communication via HiveMQ broker

Interactive dashboard with gauges and charts built using Node-RED Dashboard

Clean, modular Node-RED flows for data handling and visualization

Technologies Used
ESP32 (Arduino framework)

DHT22 sensor

MQTT (HiveMQ)

Node-RED (including Dashboard nodes)

Getting Started
Connect DHT22 sensor to ESP32

Configure WiFi and MQTT settings in the ESP32 code

Import Node-RED flows to your Node-RED instance

Access the dashboard via web browser to monitor live data
